When I meet someone new to me and I have to exchange thoughts with this person usually it takes time to get "used" to this person and vice versa.

What does that mean - "get used to the person"? Well, working with stranger people is no problem at all but I recognized something over the years of my professional life: You and your partner aren't going to understand each other from the first minute. There are questions how you mean something or what you trying to say. The problem is not the language or the slang, it is the way of thinking.

Everyone has a way to wrap his head around something and that counts for new things as well as for other's thoughts. It needs some time to synchronize the different ways of thinking until each party knows what the other is trying to tell.

How long does this phase last? I can't answer this question to 100% but the more the other person matches your way of thinking, the faster it synchronizes.

I've seen this phenomenon not only between me and my colleagues, it happens to everyone in software engineering. That doesn't mean it only happens to the software geeks, I'm pretty sure that managers, tailors, painters and sellers have the same issue.

I think Designers and Developers completely differ in the way of thinking and I'm sure that this is the cause of all problem between these two groups.
