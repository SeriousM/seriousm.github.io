Most of the time it was hard for me to bring my software into form and assigning the different parts the correct concerns.

Since i see my software as an industrial kitchen its much easier for me:

The `customer` orders a `tomato soup` from the `card`, the `chief cook` orders the `soup chief` to cook it. when the soup is ready it will be put into a `soup plate` and the `service boy` serves the soup to the costumer. a `bill` will be created by the cashdesk for later use. when the customer wants to pay the bill will be delivered by the `cashier` and the customer can `pay` his meal. too sad, the customer has to few cash and he will be sued by the `restaurant leader`. a `mail` will be send from the `lawyer` via the `post office`.

everyone got its own atomic function, everyone knows how to do it without knowing too much.

we can take the human society as an example how to act and behave with each other. if you look at the several programming patterns you will see that almost every one is replicating a human behaviour like the `observer pattern`.

looking at your software this way it will be easier to distinct the usage and function for an assembly, a method or even parts in a method.

there is a reason why the learning books are called `cookbooks`.
