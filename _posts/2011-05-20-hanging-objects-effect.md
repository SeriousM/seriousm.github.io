## Do you want to archive an effect like this? You found the solution.

_You can follow the full guide or skip the optional steps._

**1)** _Open a new Scene, delete the default Cube and add Suzanne (Monkey)._

![][2]

**2)** _Look through your Camera [NUM0] and rotate the Mesh as you want (tap [RKEY] twice for Trackball rotation)._
![][3]

**3)** _Apply the rotation with [CTRL]%2B[AKEY]. This is needed for the direction of the Threads._
![][4]

**4 opt)** _Add a Subdivision Surface Modifier (Level 2) to the Mesh and apply it because we need the additional Vertices count._
![][5]

**5 opt)** _Go into Edit Mode with [TAB], switch to Orthographic View with [NUM5] and to Top View with [NUM7]._
![][6]

**6 opt)** _Now select some random Vertices you can see from above (Top View) with the right mouse button and the [SHIFT] key._
![][7]

**7 opt)** _Switch to the Object Data in the properties panel, create a new Vertex Group with the plus sign and assign the selection to the Group. Leave the Edit Mode with [TAB]._
![][8]

**8)** _Now change to the Particles in the Properties Panel. Create a Particle System with the plus sign and change the type to Hair._
![][9]

**9)** _Tick the Advanced Options Check-box. Now set the amount to about 20 (depends on the selected Vertices), Emit from to Verts (Vertices) and set the velocity parameters (Normal to zero, Z to 1). If you rotate your Viewport now, you will see that the Hairs stands upwards now._
![][10]

**10 opt)** _Now scroll all the way down to Vertex Groups and expand the Panel. Chose the Group (selected Vertices) for Density. Now we have control where the Hairs are coming from._
![][11]

**11)** _Change to the Materials in the Properties Panel and create a new Material. You can leave the Settings as they are._
![][12]

**12)** _Change to the Textures in the Properties Panel and create a new Texture. You can chose the Texture Type Magic for an instant colorized result or chose an Image._
![][13]
![][14]
_ You can now render with [F12] and you will see a hanging Monkey face._

_The reason why this works is because the Hairs take over the color from the Material as long as the Material index is set to the Objects Material._

![][15]

**And thatâ€™s my render result:**

Happy blending :D
