#Microsoft XNA Game Studio 3.0 Unleashed

This book is really good, it describes every code line and is perfect for every one who want to start with game development!
Also, 3D Math is not sooo required, because XNA offers many helper functions to avoid this problem of missing knowledge. (like calculating martix with transformation and so on)
