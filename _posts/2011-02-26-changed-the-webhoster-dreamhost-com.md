Hey,

iâ€™ve stopped using webhostforasp.net because they are slow, has a bad and old customer panel and no extras like subdomains and so on AND, they have a slooow connection.

dreamhost is a nice hoster, good support (so far) and the impression is a good one!

so go forth dreamhost and be the good guys!
