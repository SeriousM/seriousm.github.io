Well, this is it!

It was a bit tricky because i do not want to look at tutorials to do this PinArt toy and thus it makes me some headache.

It can be animated over time and the frame itself with all associated objects (frame, glass, pins, ...) can be rotated in every direction without pain.

If someone want to see a tutorial about this, i will create one!
Just write a comment and i will look what i can do for you guys.

Just a hint:
It use a plane with the vertices as particle start point and a displacement modifier.

Here is the [.blend](/assets/pin_art_single.zip) file for free use.
