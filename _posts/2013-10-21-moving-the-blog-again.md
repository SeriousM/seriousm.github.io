Today I moved the Blog again. This time from [Dreamhost.com](http://dreamhost.com) to [GitHub.com](http://github.com).

Why? Well, three years ago I thought I will need a space to host my applications and projects but 
the world evolved and cloud computing got cheaper as well as project hostings like [Heroku.com](http://heroku.com).

And last but not least the cool offer from GitHub to host the blog on their servers [for free](http://pages.github.com/).

Thanks to Dreamhost to be such a nice host for years.
