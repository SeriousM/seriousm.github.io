With Blender 2.59 we got a very new and stable version to play with.
While exploring the new features i found two new functions!

**First - Import brush textures from a dictionary / single brush textures** (without add-on!).
After adding, you will have all your brush textures you choose in the selection box.

You can find many nice brush textures at [Pixologic ZBrush Download Central](http://www.pixologic.com/zbrush/downloadcenter/alpha/). (The .psd files can be converted to .png files with free converters.)

**Second: Brush Overlay**
This shows you where your brush would take influence on the mesh.

And also tiling / rotating (angle) of the brush is supported!

I hope you will find this information useful!
Happy blending :)
