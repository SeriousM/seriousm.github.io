**This was entirely done with Blender 3D.**

Addons:

* 2D Tracking (Tomato Branch)
* RotoBezier
* 
The free Footage comes from [hollywoodcamerawork.us](http://hollywoodcamerawork.us)

The whole process lasts ~4 hours:
(30 min 2d tracking, 15 min compositing, the remaining time: first time ever roto scoping^^)
for the first time i think i was realy fast :)

i can provide the .blend file if someone want it.
