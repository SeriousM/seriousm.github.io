  <p>
    Bernhard works at <a href="http://adventics.de/">Adventics GmbH in Vienna</a>.
    When he's not doing that, he's <a href="https://twitter.com/seriousm_bbh">Hacking and BugHunting</a>,
    documenting his <a href="https://hackernfo.com/">journey through cyber security</a> or just <a href="https://root-project.org">blogging</a>,
    hacking on <a href="https://github.com/seriousm">open source</a>,
    building frameworks (like <a href="https://github.com/SeriousM/WPFLocalizationExtension">WPF Localization Extension</a>)
    and learning new things. He has 20+ years proficiency in .net c# asp.net and other web languages, 
    but also knew something about ruby, node and wpf. He is married with the most 
    amazing girl in the world and lives with her and their two kids in Vienna, Austria.

    Bernhard used to have a pretty, bad-ass and eye-candy bloated curriculum here,
    but, well, there is so much places to update. So, check his
